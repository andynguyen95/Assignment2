		<h1><strong>IN SUMMARY</strong></h1>
		<p>Examining the data has shown several trends:
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>Edmondson Park and The Ponds and their surrounding areas are favourable locations for all age groups, as these newly developed regions offer a high quality of life with clean facilities and large living space whilst providing affordable housing in comparison to inner city areas.</li>
				<li>Residents of all age groups are being displaced from Badgery's Creek for the development of the second Sydney International Airport.</li>
				<li>20 to 40 year olds are moving closer to the city to the inner west, CBD, and eastern suburbs for work and study. Housing density is much higher due to the lack of space in these areas, which results in limited change in the number of residents here.</li>
				<li>40 to 60 year olds have moved away from the Eastern and Western suburbs towards the Blue Mountains, South Coast, and the Central Coast for a quieter lifestyle.</li>
				<li>Retirees who are 60+ are living in the Central Coast and outer western suburbs of Sydney.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1><strong>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS</strong></h1>
		<h2>Public: Department of Education</h2>
		<p>NSW Department of Education which is responsible for the delivery of primary, secondary, and tetiary education would utilise this information by determining which regions have higher proportions of youth. Subsequently the department would strive to develope and improve the educational centres in these areas to ensure that the population would have adequate access to education.</p>

		<h2>Public: New South Wales Ministry of Health</h2>
		<p>The NSW Ministry of Health monitors the performance of state and specialist health services, along with being responsible for the public health system. The department would use the data to ensure that all regions across NSW have adequate resources in their public hospitals to cater for their residents. For example, there would be an emphasis on placing child health services such as pediatricians in regions with young families, whilst aged care services would have to be accessible to retirees situated in the Central Coast.</p>
		<h2>Private: Aged Care Facilities</h2>
		<p>Developers would be interested in this data to determine optimal locations to construct new aged care facilities for an ageing population. By evaluating trends across Sydney, developers can gain an advantage over their competitors if they can be the first to provide facilities in regions with growing demands, such as in Edmondson Park and The Ponds.</p>
		<h2>Private: Home and Apartment Developers</h2>
		<p>Housing developers would use this data to both observe and predict which areas the people of Sydney are moving to, and build homes and apartment blocks to sell to potential home buyers.</p>
