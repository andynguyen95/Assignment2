		<h3><strong>What is the data set?</strong></h3>
		<p>The data set examines the distribution of age of the Australian population. This study will take an indepth look at the makeup of Sydney's 4.6 million residents. Since the spread of males and females is basically even, the focus of the study will be on where young families, middle-aged adults, and seniors tend to reside, and to discern the factors influencing any apparent trends.
